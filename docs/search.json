I have been a Radiation oncologist and a clinical researcher for the past decade and have an active publication record which you can view at the Google Scholar page here. As a part of my scientific journey I continue to learn new statistical techniques and adopt them in my practice. I am also the prinicpal investigator of several academic clinical trials and can advice you regarding your study design if needed.\nI have been using R for statistical analysis of my papers over the past decade and have learnt it like many others by trial and error along with lots of help from online sources and paper books. One of the most influential teaching in this regards has been the textbook called “Regression Modelling Strategies” by Professor Frank E Harrell, Jr. which has really shaped my views towards statistical analysis.\nLearning R has not been easy by any means but has taught me more about statistical analysis and the scientific methodology than any GUI driven program ever could. I have previously tried teaching R online but have found that the online medium does not really lend itself to teaching coding well. Hence the idea of this workshop came to my mind and I am hoping to teach this for three to four times a year.\nWhen I am not learning new data wrangling techniques I would be usually curling up with my favorite science fiction books at home usually with a box of candy.\n\n\n\nSougata Maity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi, I am Mr Sougata Maity and I will be the faculty for this course. I am a Data Imaging Scientist and currently working actively on India’s first image bank - CHAVI. My current focus is on developing tool sets that will allow us to enhance and augment this image bank in collaboration with our team members at IIT Kharagpur. I am also actively involved in developing and deploying deep learning based algorithms for various oncology tasks.\nAs a part of my career and educational journey I continue to learn coding, web development and statistical techniques and adopt them in my practice. I have been using R and Python for statistical analysis of projects as well as for data preparation and data cleaning over the last couple of years.\n\n\n\nOindrilla Roy Chowdhury\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi, I am Ms Oindrilla Roy Chowdhury and I will be the faculty for this course. I am a Data Imaging Scientist and currently working actively on India’s first image bank - CHAVI. I am actively involved in the statistical analysis of several ongoing research projects at Tata Medical Center and involved in the development of prognostic and predictive models.\nAs a part of my career and educational journey I have worked as a Bio-statistician at CRS TMH and CRS ACTREC, Mumbai."

    "text": "Hi 👋\nRecode with R - Season 2 is back with a unique focus on “Research Data Management”.\nIn this 3 day online workshop we will work with you along with your OWN project to give you a proper data management workflow which will help you downstream with reproducible statistical analysis and reporting.\n\n\n📖 Learning Objectives\n🛡️🔍 Understanding the principles of Data Quality and Ethics in Data\nUnderstand why quality in research data matters and what are the factors that influence data quality. Understand the ethical issues involved in collecting, storing, versioning and disseminating data.\n🌐🔄 Open data and data sharing - Why and How to\nGain a better understanding of why data especially research data should be openly accessible and understand resources which will allow you to share data while respecting the rights of the participants.\n📚🔍 Developing a complete data dictionary\nThe data dictionary is the fundamental part of any data. A data dictionary avoids inconsistency in data capture, analysis and reporting. It also ensures that the data are understandable and includes metadata about the data. In this course we will help you draft a data dictionary for your research project.\n📋🖊️ Designing paper case record forms\nA proper paper case record form can ease data capture requirements and may be all what you need for small and simple studies. We show you the principles that you should follow when designing a paper case record form and more importantly how to translate these to electronic systems.\n📊📝 Data management on spreadsheets (and SPSS)\nSpreadsheets ! Probably the worst way to store and manage data. Unfortunately the reality is that they are also the most common way to store data. We teach you how to do this properly (although to be truthful there is no fool proof way for this) using common spreadsheet tools.\n💻🗃️ Data management using Electronic Data Capture Systems\nWe will teach you how to use a proper electronic data capture system (a.k.a REDCap) to collect data for your research purposes. Additionally for those of you who do not have access to REDCap we also provide you with a free and open source locally hosted database solution which enables you to store and manage data properly.\nThis workshop is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of the research data capture and data management systems. Participants will learn how to manage data for their own research projects and how to use electronic tools which are geared toward research data management.\n\n\n🎒 Course Format\nA closed and small group comprising 20 to 30 participants and two to three faculty will organize the course over a week. The course will consist of three virtual contact sessions involving didactic teaching and practical demonstrations. Following each virtual contact session, we will assign practical training assignments to you. Don’t worry! These assignments won’t be examinations; rather, they will focus on applying the concepts we’ve taught. However, we do plan to incorporate some gamification to maintain engagement and make the process more enjoyable.\n\n\n📋 Pre-requisites\n📄 Study Outline Submission: As a practical course we will require a study outline for the study you will be bringing to this workshop.
