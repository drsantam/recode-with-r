Fees include lodging, meals, cloud space access, and course materials. However this course is priced quite competitively as compared to similiar courses in India.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs there any kind of restriction on the study that can be submitted ?\n\n\n\nPlease note that we are not here to judge the scientific merit of your study. That ship has sailed long ago if you are at the stage where your data is ready to be analyzed. However, if the analysis required is really esoteric we may speak with you in details to understand your requirements. This is purely so that we can devote sufficient time for each candidate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill a certificate be provided ?\n\n\n\nThis is not a certification course and we cannot provide any education certification for attending the course. A participation certificate will be provided if you desire on letterhead for official leave purposes at your institute."

    "text": "Hi, I am Dr Santam Chakraborty and I will be the principal faculty for this course. I have been a Radiation oncologist and a clinical researcher for the past decade and have an active publication record which you can view at the Google Scholar page here. As a part of my scientific journey I continue to learn new statistical techniques and adopt them in my practice. I am also the prinicpal investigator of several academic clinical trials and can advice you regarding your study design if needed.\nI have been using R for statistical analysis of my papers over the past decade and have learnt it like many others by trial and error along with lots of help from online sources and paper books. One of the most influential teaching in this regards has been the textbook called “Regression Modelling Strategies” by Professor Frank E Harrell, Jr. which has really shaped my views towards statistical analysis.\nLearning R has not been easy by any means but has taught me more about statistical analysis and the scientific methodology than any GUI driven program ever could. I have previously tried teaching R online but have found that the online medium does not really lend itself to teaching coding well. Hence the idea of this workshop came to my mind and I am hoping to teach this for three to four times a year.\nWhen I am not learning new data wrangling techniques I would be usually curling up with my favorite science fiction books at home usually with a box of candy."
