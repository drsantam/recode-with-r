    "text": "Hi 👋\nRecode with R is a unique 3 day workshop designed for health care professionals with an interest in research and who are keen to learn statistical data analysis & visualization. An element of being comfortable with being outside your comfort zone is also needed as in this workshop we will be helping you write code for analysis of your data.\nIn this 3 day workshop we will work with you along with your OWN dataset (no toy or dummy data here) to give you a manuscript ready result while you are learning valuable skills in R and statistical analysis.\n\n\nImportant Dates\nLast date of registration & abstract submission: 31st December 2023\nDate of Workshop : 17th - 19th January 2024.\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n📊 Drafting a Statistical Analysis Plan\nDevelop skills to create a comprehensive plan for statistical analysis, ensuring a structured and goal-oriented approach to data examination.\n🧹 Data Cleaning and Pivoting\nLearn techniques for refining data, removing inaccuracies, and transforming data structures for more effective analysis.\n🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis\nEngage in initial investigations of data to discover patterns, spot anomalies, and test hypotheses using various methods.\n📈 Describing Your Data\nGain expertise in summarizing and interpreting your data sets, providing a clear understanding of the underlying characteristics.\n📉 Regression Modelling\nMaster the art of building regression models to understand and predict relationships between variables in your data.\n⏳ Survival Analysis\nExplore survival analysis techniques to predict the time until an event of interest.\n🌈 Advanced Visualization and Grammar of Graphics\nDelve into sophisticated data visualization methods and learn the grammar of graphics for more impactful data presentation.\nThis workshop is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of various aspects of data analysis, from the initial planning stages to advanced visualization techniques. Participants will learn how to clean and pivot data, perform exploratory analysis, describe data effectively, build regression models, conduct survival analysis, and create advanced visual representations. This program is ideal for those looking to deepen their understanding and skills in statistical data analysis.\nPerhaps and most importantly we will be teaching you the tools of trade that will enable you to analyze your data in a reproducible fashion. In order to achieve this we will be teaching you how to code in R and use various packages and libraries that\n\n\nCourse Format\nClosed and small group of 8 - 10 participants and two to three faculty. Based on the kind of studies we will be handling we may invite external faculty who are experienced with hands on analysis with R in the area of question. Each participant will bring their own dataset for the workshop and will work on their own statistical plan. However we will use all of your datasets to teach you valuables skills that you can use for your future projects. All users will be provided with access to a free cloud workspace where they can securely store their dataset(s) and analytical results.\n\n\nPre-requisites\n📄 Abstract Submission: A brief abstract with the background of the research question, the objectives, and the methodology of the study will enable us to prepare for your analysis in advance. In addition we may choose to invite experts who will specifically assist you in your analysis.\n💾 A dataset for Analysis: Data should be in a machine-readable format. We will provide you with instructions on how to ensure data is prepared for analysis so that valuable workshop time is not wasted in this. We recommend that this data is related to a real project / research you are directly involved in so that you have the maximum “skin in the game”.\n💻 Your Own Laptop: Network connection will be provided 🤝.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPlease note that this is an intensive hands on course and suitable for you only if you can give the time commitment. Also no SPSS related help will be provided during or after the course.\n\n\n\n\nCourse Fees\n\nCourse Fees\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nAmount\n\n\n\n\nHealth Care Professionals from India and SAARC nations or LMICs and working in a hospital setting\n₹ 25,000 (~ $300)\n\n\nHealth care professionals working in other countries\n₹ 50,000 (~ $ 600 )\n\n\nHealthcare professionals working in Industry\n₹ 75,000 (~ $ 900)\n\n\n\nThe course fee includes:\n\nLodging in twin sharing basis during the course if you are out of station from Kolkata.\nLunch and coffee during the workshop.\nAccess to a cloud based space which you can use for your analysis for 10 days after the course.\nUnlimited access to a private repository with course materials.\n\nPlease note transportation to / from the venue is not included. However the lodging premises will be very near to Tata Medical Center and will be easily accessible by public transportation.\nAdditionally we have provision to provide scholarships to meritorious students. Please note scholarships will be provided as cash awards after completion of the workshop and can be used by you to defray the costs incurred towards the course fees. Selection to the scholarship will be done by the course organizers and there is no obligation to provide a scholarship.\n\n\nRegistration\nPlease register online here."
