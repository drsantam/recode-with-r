Kolkata or the "City of Joy" is a metropolis located in the Eastern state of India - West Bengal. Long known as the cultural and gastronomic capital of the country, Kolkata is well connected by Rail, Road and Air with the rest of the country and other Asian nations.

Please read the wikipedia entry for the city [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata "About Kolkata"){target="_blank"}.

Please do note that the workshop is intensive and it is unlikely that you will find any time to move around in the city during the three days of the course. You may want to reserve Saturday for the same. 😁

💥Trivia: Kolkata is the home to the [Indian Statistical Institute](https://www.isical.ac.in/ "ISI Calcutta"){target="_blank"} (ISI). Both [Prof Prasanta Chandra Mahalonbis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prasanta_Chandra_Mahalanobis "PC Mahalonbis"){target="_blank"}and [Prof C.R.Rao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._R._Rao "C.R.Rao"){target="_blank"} have headed this prestigious institute. Please do note that Tata Medical Center is not affiliated with Indian Statistical Institute and this course has nothing to do with ISI.
