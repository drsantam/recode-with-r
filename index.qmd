# Hi 👋

**Recode with R** is a unique 3 day workshop designed for health care professionals with an interest in research and who are keen to learn statistical data analysis & visualization. An element of being comfortable with being outside your comfort zone is also needed as in this workshop we will be helping you write code for analysis of your data.

In this 3 day workshop we will work with you along with your **OWN dataset** (no toy or dummy data here) to give you a manuscript ready result while you are learning valuable skills in R and statistical analysis.

# Learning Objectives

📊 **Drafting a Statistical Analysis Plan**\
*Develop skills to create a comprehensive plan for statistical analysis, ensuring a structured and goal-oriented approach to data examination.*

🧹 **Data Cleaning and Pivoting**\
*Learn techniques for refining data, removing inaccuracies, and transforming data structures for more effective analysis.*

🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis**\
*Engage in initial investigations of data to discover patterns, spot anomalies, and test hypotheses using various methods.*

📈 **Describing Your Data**\
*Gain expertise in summarizing and interpreting your data sets, providing a clear understanding of the underlying characteristics.*

📉 **Regression Modelling**\
*Master the art of building regression models to understand and predict relationships between variables in your data.*

⏳ **Survival Analysis**\
*Explore survival analysis techniques to predict the time until an event of interest.*

🌈 **Advanced Visualization and Grammar of Graphics**\
*Delve into sophisticated data visualization methods and learn the grammar of graphics for more impactful data presentation.*

This workshop is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of various aspects of data analysis, from the initial planning stages to advanced visualization techniques. Participants will learn how to clean and pivot data, perform exploratory analysis, describe data effectively, build regression models, conduct survival analysis, and create advanced visual representations. This program is ideal for those looking to deepen their understanding and skills in statistical data analysis.

Perhaps and most importantly we will be teaching you the tools of trade that will enable you to analyze your data in a reproducible fashion. In order to achieve this we will be teaching you how to code in R and use various packages and libraries that

# Course Format

Closed and small group of 8 - 10 participants and two to three faculty. Based on the kind of studies we will be handling we may invite external faculty who are experienced with hands on analysis with R in the area of question. Each participant will bring their own dataset for the workshop and will work on their own statistical plan. However we will use all of your datasets to teach you valuables skills that you can use for your future projects. All users will be provided with access to a free cloud workspace where they can securely store their dataset(s) and analytical results.

# Pre-requisites

📄 **Abstract Submission**: A brief abstract with the background of the research question, the objectives, and the methodology of the study will enable us to prepare for your analysis in advance.

💾 **Dataset for Analysis**: Data should be in a machine-readable format. We will provide you with instructions on how to ensure data is cleaned for analysis.

💻 **Your Own Laptop**: Network connection will be provided 🤝.
