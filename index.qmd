# Hi 👋

**Recode with R** - **Season 2** is back with a unique focus on "Research Data Management".

In this **3 day online workshop** we will work with you along with your **OWN project** to give you a **proper data management workflow** which will help you downstream with reproducible statistical analysis and reporting.

# 📖 Learning Objectives

🛡️🔍 **Understanding the principles of Data Quality and Ethics in Data**

Understand why quality in research data matters and what are the factors that influence data quality. Understand the ethical issues involved in collecting, storing, versioning and disseminating data.

🌐🔄 **Open data and data sharing - Why and How to**

Gain a better understanding of why data especially research data should be openly accessible and understand resources which will allow you to share data while respecting the rights of the participants.

📚🔍 **Developing a complete data dictionary**

The data dictionary is the fundamental part of any data. A data dictionary avoids inconsistency in data capture, analysis and reporting. It also ensures that the data are understandable and includes metadata about the data. In this course we will help you draft a data dictionary for your research project.

📋🖊️ **Designing paper case record forms**

A proper paper case record form can ease data capture requirements and may be all what you need for small and simple studies. We show you the principles that you should follow when designing a paper case record form and more importantly how to translate these to electronic systems.

📊📝 **Data management on spreadsheets (and SPSS)**

Spreadsheets ! Probably the worst way to store and manage data. Unfortunately the reality is that they are also the most common way to store data. We teach you how to do this properly (although to be truthful there is no fool proof way for this) using common spreadsheet tools.

💻🗃️ **Data management using Electronic Data Capture Systems**

We will teach you how to use a proper electronic data capture system (a.k.a REDCap) to collect data for your research purposes. Additionally for those of you who do not have access to REDCap we also provide you with a free and open source locally hosted database solution which enables you to store and manage data properly.

This workshop is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of the research data capture and data management systems. Participants will learn how to manage data for their own research projects and how to use electronic tools which are geared toward research data management.

# 🎒 Course Format

A closed and small group comprising 20 to 30 participants and two to three faculty will organize the course over a week. The course will consist of three virtual contact sessions involving didactic teaching and practical demonstrations. Following each virtual contact session, we will assign practical training assignments to you. Don't worry! These assignments won't be examinations; rather, they will focus on applying the concepts we've taught. However, we do plan to incorporate some gamification to maintain engagement and make the process more enjoyable.

# 📋 Pre-requisites

📄 **Study Outline Submission**: As a practical course we will require a study outline for the study you will be bringing to this workshop. We will need an outline of the following:

1.  Brief study background
2.  Objectives, outcomes and Endpoints.
3.  Baseline variables of interest which may influence results.
4.  Study design and methods.

💻 **Your Own Computer**: This is a completely online course Duh !
